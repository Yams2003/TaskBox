I am a software engineer major with plans to also minor in security technology and finance. I was inspired to learn about technology after spending most of my childhood interacting with cool gadgets and consoles such as Nintendo game systems and a personal PC. I look forward to learning many things during my time at Drexel University, especially as someone who never spent time in highschool taking any CS classes. I am mainly motivated by the drive of engaging with new topics and creating something that can be visually pleasing.
