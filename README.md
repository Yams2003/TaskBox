# Taskmaster

Our project/product "TaskBox" in essence is a task management tool that is geared toward helping individuals manage their weekly obligations, increasing organizational skills, and reducing the anxiety of missing assignments or tasks. To successfully contribute to the project, familiarity and proficiency in languages such as Python, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS are necessary. It would be very helpful to be familiar with web frameworks, the one we are currently using is Flask.
